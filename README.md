 # UART Core Implementation

Welcome to the UART Core Implementation repository! This project provides a complete UART communication solution in Verilog, consisting of transmitter (`uart_tx`), receiver (`uart_rx`), and supporting modules. The core includes a baud rate generator for timing control. The project's primary goal is to enable seamless serial communication between devices using the UART protocol.

## Overview

The UART Core Implementation project revolves around delivering a robust UART communication solution in Verilog. The core consists of three pivotal modules, each serving a distinct purpose, and a comprehensive test bench to ensure flawless functionality.

## Modules

### UART Transmitter (`uart_tx`)

The `uart_tx` module orchestrates the transmission of data over UART. It takes parallel data inputs and adeptly converts them into serial data, complete with start, data, parity, and stop bits.

### UART Receiver (`uart_rx`)

With the `uart_rx` module at its core, this project effortlessly handles the reception of UART data. It adeptly converts incoming serial data—packaged with start, data, parity, and stop bits—into parallel data.

### Baud Rate Generator (`baud_generator`)

The `baud_generator` module, an essential companion to the UART core, diligently generates the requisite clock ticks. By doing so, it maintains impeccable synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver.

## UART Protocol Overview

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a widely used serial communication protocol that enables asynchronous communication between devices. It uses two lines for communication: one for transmitting data (TX) and one for receiving data (RX). UART operates without a clock signal and relies on predefined baud rates for synchronization.

In UART communication, data is sent in packets, each consisting of a start bit, data bits, an optional parity bit, and one or more stop bits. The start bit signals the beginning of a data packet, and the stop bit(s) indicate the end. Parity can be used for error detection.

The baud rate determines the rate at which data is transmitted and received. The baud rate generator (`baud_generator` module in this project) generates clock ticks that dictate the timing of data transmission and reception.

## Test Bench

To thoroughly validate the integrity of the UART core, we've developed an exhaustive test bench (`testbench.sv`). This test bench dynamically generates random data, subjects it to the `uart_tx` module, captures it through the `uart_rx` module, and finally compares the received data with the transmitted data. This meticulous process ensures that the UART core performs reliably and consistently.

## Testing Procedure

To conduct a comprehensive test of the UART core implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
